## Muspyche

> *Yet another Mustache library*

Muspyche is a Mustache templating framework library for Python 3.
It was forked from [Pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache) library.

----

**Written for Python 3**

Muspche was started after the release of Python 3.4 (in April, 2014).
This means that by default the language grants it two things that are
extremely important for templating framework:

- full Unicode support,
- clear distinction of bytes and text.

At the moment, Muspyche does not aim to be compatible with programs written
in Python 2.x.
